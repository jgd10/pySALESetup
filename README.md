# pySALESetup
pySALESetup is a preprocessing tool designed for use with iSALE2D www.iSALE-code.de
It is a python module that allows for the setup of complex geometries in 2D simulations.
This is of particular use in granular mesoscale numerical simulations and example
scripts are also included.

See the docs folder for a rough guide to its functionality.

This is a work in progress and will be incorporated into the iSALE repository in due course.
It should be available in iSALE in the next stable releasel.
